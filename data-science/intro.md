Analysis -- past data by breaking data sets to sets

Analytics -- Future , Exploring patterns
  Qulitative Analytics -- Intitution + Analysis (how? +why?)
  Quantitative Analytics --formulas + algorithms (when and how in future?)
  
Business Intelligence -- the process of analysing and reporting historical data
                         aims to explain past events based on business data

Machine Learning -- the ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed

   it is about creating and implementing algorithms that let machines receive data and use data to
     make predictions
     analyse patterns
     give recommendations
     
Artificial Intelligence -- simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers

BI -- 
  Observations
  quantifications -- The process of representing observations as numbers
  measures
  metric -- A measure that has a business meaning attached is called:
  
KPI -- Key Performance Indicators 
   a metric that is tightly aligned with your business objectives
   
The job of a business intelligence analyst always involves the creation of -- reports, dashboards,KPIs

***Traditional Methods***
Regression   (linear)
Logistic Regression
cluster Analysis(clustering) rows -- data is divided into a few groups
Factor Analysis  columns ---if you want to reduce the dimensionality of a certain statistical problem
Time series Analysis --plotting values against time, shown always on the horizontal line


**Machine Learning**
ML Algorithm -- a trial and error process( each consecutive trial is good than previous)

the core ML is creating algorithm which a computer then uses to find a model that fits the data as best as possible

in one doesnt give machine instructions,instead provides algorithms on how to learn on its own

Data - Model - Objective Function - Optimization Algorithm

Types of ML::

1)Supervised Learning (labeled data)
2)Unsupervised learning (unlabeled data)
3)Reinforcement learning (reward)

Deep learning ( accurate results ) same ml types

In reinforcement learning, a reward system is being used to improve the machine learning model at hand. The idea of using this reward system is to: maximize objective function


P(A)= prefered/all
